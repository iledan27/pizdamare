First Tutorial:

 This link is an interactive course for javascript. It's fun and very helpful.

 Second Tutorial:
 - https://www.tutorialspoint.com/javascript/index.htm
 On the link, start with the first lecture "Javascript - Home" and go throw all until the lecture "Javascript - Events" including the last one. 
 This is more like a lesson just to read and strengthen all your knowledge from the first tutorial.
